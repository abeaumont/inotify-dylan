inotify-dylan
=============

These are the Dylan bindings for 
`inotify <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inotify>`_, the Linux kernel subsystem
that notifies applications about changes to the filesystem.

To build these bindings you will need 
`melange <https://github.com/dylan-lang/melange>`_ installed first. Then
simply run ``make`` to build inotify-dylan.
